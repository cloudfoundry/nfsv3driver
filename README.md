# nfsv3driver
This driver mounts NFS3 shares using a fuse-mount library to allow additional control over the uid & gid transmitted to the nfs server in RPC calls.  For more information about using this driver in your Cloud Foundry, visit the [nfs-volume-release git repository](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nfs-volume-release).
